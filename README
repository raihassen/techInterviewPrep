1.cpp A company's organizational structure is represented as 
1: 2, 3, 4 
In the above employees with id 2, 3 and 4 report to 1 
Assume the following hierarchy. 
1: 2, 3, 4 
3: 5, 6, 7 
5: 8, 9, 10 
Given an employee Id, return all the employees reporting to him directly or indirectly
2.cpp Implement a function that given an integer number num, it returns the a string representation of the number, comma separated.
i.e. f(1234) = “1,234”
3.cpp Bracket matching:
You are given a string consisting of brackets and other characters. You have to tell if it is a well balanced string. See below for example:

/*

"(aa)bb" -> true
"[ aa [ bbb ]" -> false
"aa } bbb { c" -> false
"aa [ bb () ]" -> true
"[aa { ] cc } ]" -> false

*/
4.cpp Run length encoding of string. See below for example:

aaaaabbbccd => a5b3c2d1
xyz => x1y1z1
5.cpp Merge overlapping intervals. See below for example:

[1,3] [2,5] [8,9] => [1,5] [8,9]
[1,3] [2,6] [4,99] => [1,99]
